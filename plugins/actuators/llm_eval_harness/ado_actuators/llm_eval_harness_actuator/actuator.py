# In case we need configurable parameters for our actuator, we can create a class that inherits from the pydantic model GenericActuatorParameters,
# and reference it in the "parameters_class" class variable of our actuator.
#
# Users will be able to create instance of this class with specific options for the actuator (ado create actuatorconfiguration)
# These will be stored in a project in a metastore
# Users will also be able to get a default for this template using (ado template actuatorconfiguration)
#
# Details: How this model is used to store a set of parameters or to show  parameters to users
#
# When storing this pydantic model, the serialized representation is obtained using pydantic model_dump() with no options.
# When outputting, the serialized representation is obtained also with model_dump(), and for schema with  model_dump_schema().
# In general, commands that output a serialization of the object (ado template, ado get)  may include options to
# model_dump to include None values or default values.
# However, the stored representation is always that produced by model_dump() with no options.
