# Shared Sample Stores

In `ado`, Entities and measurement results are stored in a database called a
**Sample Store**. For more on how Sample Stores are configured and managed see
[their dedicated page](../resources/sample-stores.md).

Two principles underpin data reuse in `ado`:

- **A Sample Store can be shared across multiple Discovery Spaces.** This allows
  any Discovery Space to access Entities and measurements recorded by operations
  on other Discovery Spaces that use the same store.
- **Each Entity has exactly one record in a Sample Store.** If two Discovery
  Spaces both include the same Entity, they reference the same record — there is
  no duplication.

> [!NOTE]
>
> To maximise the chance of data reuse, similar Discovery Spaces should use the
> same Sample Store. However, any Discovery Spaces can share a store regardless
> of how similar they are.

## How `ado` matches shared data

### Entities

In `ado` two Entities are the same if they have identical
sets of [constitutive property](properties-and-domains.md#property-types) values.
Hence, `ado` uses [constitutive property](properties-and-domains.md#property-types)
values to check
if an Entity is present in the Sample Store,
regardless of which Discovery Space originally recorded them.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
> The match does not use Entity identifiers as there are
> situations where they could be  different even for Entities
> with same constitutive properties.

### Measurements

When an Entity is retrieved from the Sample Store, it carries
the results of all Experiments that have been applied to it. `ado` checks
whether any of those experiment identifiers match an Experiment in the current
Measurement Space — if so, the result can be reused.

## Data retrieval modes

When retrieving data from a Discovery Space (e.g. via `ado show entities`),
there are two modes that control whether shared data is included:

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->
| Mode | What is returned |
| --- | --- |
| **measured** | Only Entities and measurements recorded by operations run directly on *this* Discovery Space. Compatible data from other spaces is excluded. |
| **matching** | All Entities and measurements in the Sample Store that are compatible with this Discovery Space, regardless of which space produced them. |
<!-- markdownlint-enable line-length -->

Use **measured** when you want to see only the results your operations have
produced. Use **matching** when you want the full picture including any
compatible data from other spaces.

## Memoization

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Each explore operator provides a way to turn memoization on and off. See the
> [random walk](../operators/random-walk.md) and
> [ray tune](../operators/optimisation-with-ray-tune.md) operator documentation
> for how to control this setting.

*Memoization* is the name for data reuse that happens automatically during an
explore operation. When an operation samples an Entity it proceeds as follows:

- The Entity is sampled from the Entity Space
- The Entity's record is retrieved from the Sample Store if present
  - This match is on constitutive property values
- If **memoization is on**
    - for each Experiment in the Measurement Space, `ado` checks
      if a result for it already exists (via the Experiment's unique identifier)
        - if it does, the result is reused. If there is more than one result,
          they are all reused
- If **memoization is off**
    - existing results are ignored. Each Experiment in the Measurement Space is
      applied again to the Entity. The new results are added to any existing.

See [explore operators](../operators/explore_operators.md#memoization-replaying-measurements)
for how memoization fits into the explore execution loop, and
[Discovery Spaces](discovery-spaces.md#sampling-and-measurement) for how
operations and spaces relate.
