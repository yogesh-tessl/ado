A core task is sampling and measuring `entities` from a `discoveryspace` and
this is the objective of explore `operators`. In fact, other than copying data
from an external source, `operations` using _explore_ `operators` are the only
way new entities can be sampled and measurements performed.

Because `operations` of the explore operators do more than just modify or
analyse data, but result in measurements being executed and `entities` being
placed in the `samplestore`, it's worth diving into them in more detail.

## Timeseries

Every explore operation samples entities and performs measurements in some
sequence, hence there is an associated timeseries. This timeseries is recorded
for every `explore` operation. To see it via `ado` CLI use:

```commandline
ado show entities operation $OPERATION_IDENTIFIER
```

This will output a table of the entities in the order they were sampled during
the operation.

You can access this information programmatically by modifying the following
snippet:

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->
```python
import yaml
from orchestrator.core.discoveryspace.space import DiscoverySpace
from orchestrator.metastore.project import ProjectContext

with open("my_context.yaml") as f:
    c = ProjectContext.model_validate(yaml.safe_load(f))

space = DiscoverySpace.from_stored_configuration(project_context=c, space_identifier='space_abc123')
# Get the timeseries of a property `someproperty` measured by `someexperiment from the space
# for operation "operation_abc123". You can also omit the limit_to_properties parameter to retrieve
# all the properties
space.complete_measurement_request_with_results_timeseries(operation_id="operation_abc123",
                                                           limit_to_properties=["someexperiment.someproperty"])
```
<!-- markdownlint-enable line-length -->

Importantly, the same entity can be visited by multiple different `operations`.
Looking at the `entity` will not show which `operation` measured which value.
However, this information is accessible via the timeseries.

## The core explore loop

Each explore operation will perform the following steps in some way:

- Sample 1 or more entities from the `discoveryspace`
- For each experiment in the `measurementspace`:
  - If it has been already executed on this entity AND memoization is on
    - replay the already measured value
  - Otherwise:
    - call the actuator to perform the measurement
- Wait until all measurements have completed
  - As each completes:
    - add the entity to the `samplestore` if it's not there
    - add the completed (replayed/new) measurement to the `samplestore`

### Memoization: Replaying Measurements

A core goal of `ado` is transparent data-sharing. This is enabled via the
[common context provided by `samplestores`](../resources/sample-stores.md) and
the schema used to store `entities`.

To leverage this data-sharing capability explore operations will, by default, not
re-measure an entity they sample if it already has data for that measurement.
For example, an explore operation samples an entity from a space whose
`measurementspace` includes an experiment called "myexperiment-v1". If it sees
the entity has values for experiment `myexperiment-v1`, it won't execute it
again, instead it replays it, and feature called **memoization**.

This means if a different user sampled and measured this entity with this
experiment on a different space we transparently reuse their results, saving
execution time.

Explore operators should allow turning memoization on and off.

If memoization is off, the entity will be re-measured with the
experiment and it will have two values for each
[observed property](../core-concepts/actuators.md#target-and-observed-properties)
of that experiment. Going back to our example above, if `myexperiment-v1` was executed
again, and it measured properties `prop1` and `prop2`, then the entity will have
two values for `myexperiment-v1.prop1` and `myexperiment-v1.prop2`, one from
each time the experiment was applied to that entity.

What if you switch it on but an entity has multiple measurements of the same
experiment? In this case _each existing measurement is replayed_. In our
example, this would mean if an entity has had `myexperiment-v1` applied twice,
and then is sampled again with memoization on, two measurements will be
replayed: the first and the second.

### Failed measurements

If a measurement of an entity fails in a way not expected by the `actuator` i.e.
it could not measure any of its target properties, the `entity` will be added to
the `samplestore` (if it was not present already); the `operation` will proceed;
but this entity will have no measured values for this experiment.

If a measurement fails it is termed `invalid`.
An Invalid measurement does not measure anything.
However, invalid measurements are still added to the `samplestore`.
This allows you to see a list of all measurements in an operation, even
those that failed, along with the failure reason.

> Since failed measurements don't measure any properties they are not memoized.

## Exploration operation metadata

When an explore operation finishes, the system (top-level) metadata field of the
associated `operation` resource is updated with the following fields.

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->
```python
entities_submitted: #The number of entities sampled from the space
experiments_requested: #The number of experiments requested - should be (number of experiments in measurement space)*entitiesSampled
```
<!-- markdownlint-enable line-length -->

Example from a completed random walk `operation`:

```yaml
config:
  metadata:
    description:
      Both single and multi GPU runs of GPTQ-LoRA experiments for first group of
      GPTQ-LoRA
    labels:
      group: "1"
      group_type: gptq-lora
      issue: "904"

## Viewing the `operation` and `discoveryspace` state as an operation runs

As an `operation` is running new measurements are being performed, entities
added, and some fraction of the requested entities will have been sampled. Some
`ado` commands reflect this changing state while other do not.

Commands that reflect changing state during an `operation`:

- `ado show entities space`
- `ado show entities operation`
- `ado show details space`

Commands that do not reflect changing state during an `operation`:

- `ado get operation $OPERATION_IDENTIFIER`
- `ado show details operation $OPERATION_IDENTIFIER`

The `operation` resource itself will be updated with metadata when the operation
finishes but not while it is running.
`ado show details operation $OPERATION_IDENTIFIER` uses this metadata, so it
will not be correct until the operation is finished.
