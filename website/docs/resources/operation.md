## `operator` and `operation`

An `operator` is a code module that provides a capability to perform an
`operation` on a `discoveryspace`. For example the `RandomWalk` operator
provides the capability to perform a random walk `operation` on a
`discoveryspace`.

The `operator` defines the inputs arguments you can set for its `operations`.

The [operators](../operators/working-with-operators.md) section contains more
details about the available `operators`, their functionality and usage them.
In particular [explore operators](../operators/explore_operators.md) provides
details on how you sample and measure entities from a `discoveryspace`.
This page covers how you create and work with `operations` using a given `operator`
in general.

## Creating an `operation` resource

### Pre-requisites

The only pre-requisite to creating an `operation` is that there is a suitable
`discoveryspace` for it to work on.

### Getting input options and potential values

You can get a default input options for an operation along with a description of
its fields by executing

```commandline
ado template operation --operator-name $OPERATOR_NAME --include-schema
```

In addition, check the [operator](../operators/working-with-operators.md)
section for an entry for the particular $OPERATOR_NAME for more detail.

!!! info end

    The `ado template operation` command will always output the latest arguments
    schema for the operator. So use this if the online documentation does not seem
    to work as it may have fallen behind.

### The `operation` configuration YAML

All `operations` share a configuration structure with three top-level fields

```yaml
spaces: # This list of spaces to operate on
  - space_abc123
operation:
  module: # Describes the operator to use - more below
    ...
  parameters: # The input arguments for this operation
actuatorConfigurationIdentifiers: # Optional
  - actuatorconfiguration-name-123
```

Each `operator` defines its own input arguments. As a result the fields under
`operation.parameters` of every operation will be different. To get an initial
set of parameter values, use one of the following methods

- Follow the previous section and use `ado template operation`
- Check if there is an entry for the `operator` in the
  [operator](../operators/working-with-operators.md) section of the
  documentation website.
- Check the [examples](../examples/examples.md) section to see if there is an
  example of using the given `operator`

For illustrative purposes here is a configuration for a random walk operation

```YAML
spaces: ###The spaces to operate on
  - 'space-630588-bfebfe'
operation: #The operators
  module: # The operator will be random_walk
    operatorName: random_walk
    operationType: search
  parameters: # The parameters for this RandomWalk operation
    numberEntities: 60
    batchSize: 1
    mode: 'sequential'
    samplerType: 'generator'
actuatorConfigurationIdentifiers:
  - actuatorconfiguration-st4sd-3cb3bb82
```

### Specifying the `operator`

The command `ado get operators` will list the names and types of the known
operators e.g.

```commandline
┌───────┬─────────────┬─────────┐
│ INDEX │ OPERATOR    │ TYPE    │
├───────┼─────────────┼─────────┤
│ 0     │ random_walk │ explore │
│ 1     │ ray_tune    │ explore │
│ 2     │ rifferla    │ modify  │
└───────┴─────────────┴─────────┘
```

You use this information to specify the operator to use in the operation YAML,
for example:

```yaml
module:
  operatorName: rifferla # The name of the operator
  operationType: modify #The type of the operation/operator
```

> [!WARNING]
>
> To use operators listed with type _explore_ by `ado get operators`, currently
> you must set operationType to **search** e.g.
>
> ```yaml
> module: 
>  operatorName: random_walk 
>  operationType: search # note: search not explore
> ```

### Passing actuator parameters

If you need to provide parameters to the actuators defined on the space, you can
do it via the `actuatorConfigurationIdentifiers` field.

For example, the below shows an operation specifying an actuator configuration
for the `st4sd` actuator.

```yaml
spaces: ###The spaces to operate on
  - "space-630588-bfebfe"
operation: #The operators
  ... # The operation config
actuatorConfigurationIdentifiers:
  - actuatorconfiguration-st4sd-3cb3bb82
```

The actuator configurations provided must belong to one of the actuators defined
on the space(s) operated on and only one actuator configuration can be provided
for each actuator. Both these conditions are checked on creating the `operation`
resource and an appropriate error message is output if they are not.

### Starting the operation

Executing

```commandline
ado create operation -f OPERATION.YAML
```

creates the `operation` resource in the active context and initiates
whatever that operation does. The operation executes synchronously with this
command i.e. it will not return until the operation is complete.

Before creating, and hence starting, the `operation`, the `parameters` will be
validated with the `operator`. If they are not valid e.g. a required argument is
missing, the `create` operation will fail with a relevant error.

!!! info end

    Although the `create` command does not exit until the operation is finished
    distributed users querying the same context will be able to see the created
    operation, from the moment it is created.

### `operation` resource specific fields

`operation` resources have two additional top-level fields in addition to common
ones described in [resources](resources.md#common-features-of-resources) These
are (with example values):

```yaml
operationType: characterize # The type of the operation: characterize, modify etc.
operatorIdentifier: profile-1.1 # The identifier of the operator including its version
```

## Getting `operation` output

An operation can create any type of ado resource. To see the resources created
by an operation with identifier $OPERATION_IDENTIFIER use:

```commandline
ado show related operation $OPERATION_IDENTIFIER
```

Output that is text, tables or locations will be contained in a `datacontainer`
resource. It can be output with:

```commandline
ado describe datacontainer $DATACONTAINER_IDENTIFIER
```

See [datacontainers](datacontainer.md) for more details.

## `operation` status update events

In addition to the
[status update events common to all resources](resources.md#resource-status)
`operations` define two more events: `started` and `finished`.

The finished event also has a custom field `exit_state` which described how the
operation finished. It can be `success`, `fail` or `error`.

Here is an example of the status field of an operation resource after it has
completed

```yaml
created: "2024-12-19T10:54:42.015388Z"
identifier: raytune-0.7.5.dev10+g731d1e21.d20241218-ax-018647
kind: operation
metadata:
  entities_submitted: 11
  experiments_requested: 11
operationType: search
operatorIdentifier: raytune-0.7.5.dev10+g731d1e21.d20241218
status:
  - event: created
    recorded_at: "2025-09-02T09:09:02.187149Z"
  - event: added
    recorded_at: "2025-09-02T09:09:15.187747Z"
  - event: started
    recorded_at: "2025-09-02T09:09:15.190337Z"
  - event: updated
    recorded_at: "2025-09-02T09:09:15.190383Z"
  - event: finished
    exit_state: success
    message: Ray Tune operation completed successfully
    recorded_at: "2025-09-02T09:11:28.047676Z"
  - event: updated
    recorded_at: "2025-09-02T09:11:29.096685Z"
version: v1
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> The first updated status reflects an update to the stored operation resource
> which added the `started` event. The second updated status reflects an update
> to the stored operation resource which added the `finished` event.

## Deleting operations

!!!info

    Please note that
    [standard deletion constraints](resources.md#deleting-resources) apply alongside
    the considerations discussed in this section.

!!!warning

    Deleting an operation that uses the replay actuator **will also
    remove the original measurements from the database**, making it impossible for
    it to be run again on the same sample store.

Deleting an operation is a destructive action that also removes associated data.
The deletion process follows this logic:

- Requests associated with the operation are deleted if their results are not
  referenced by other operations
- Results are deleted **only if they are no longer referenced by any remaining
  requests**.

This means that if a measurement result has been reused (e.g., replayed) in
another operation, it will not be deleted.

### Restrictions

By default, operations cannot be deleted while other operations are still
running. This safeguard prevents potential consistency issues, such as deleting
results that are actively being replayed in a running operation.

To override this restriction, you can use the
[--force option](../getting-started/ado.md#ado-delete), which allows deletion
even when other operations are in progress.
